# Instagram Search
[View Live Demo](http://tbone849.github.io/instagram-search/)
## Description
An Angular app I created during my time learning at [Thinkful](http://www.thinkful.com). The app will search for instagram images by tag provided by the user. Currently, the app will only search my instagram account because my developer account is in sandbox mode till it gets verified. You can still test the app for functionality by using the following search tags:
* movie (will currently display all images associated with my account)
* hunger games 
* superman
* maze runner
* avengers
* inception
* hook
* hobbit
* star trek
* tmnt
* ghostbusters
* terminator
